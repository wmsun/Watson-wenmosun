Pre-proccessed lucene file can be found at https://arizona.app.box.com/folder/127728520957?s=qwe6gt7ril5o3xsjio2twux3dkcaf4uv
It also contains the provide wiki-subset folder that I didn't upload with the code.
Adding lucene-files (and wiki-subset if needed) to the resources folder under the same directory will let the program work.
Thank you!
